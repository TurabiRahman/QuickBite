## 2. Relational Table – Entity Relationships

| Entity 1        | Relationship Name          | Entity 2    | Cardinality / Notes                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| USER (customer) | places                     | ORDER       | 1:N – One customer can place many orders      |
| USER (vendor)   | receives / manages_orders  | ORDER       | 1:N – One vendor can manage many orders       |
| ORDER           | contains                   | ORDER_ITEM  | 1:N – Each order can have multiple order items |
| FOOD            | part_of                    | ORDER_ITEM  | 1:N – Each food can appear in multiple order items |
| USER (vendor)   | manages                    | FOOD        | 1:N – Each vendor manages multiple foods      |
| ORDER           | paid_by                    | PAYMENT     | 1:1 – Each order has one payment record       |

## 3. Design Notes

1. `ORDER_ITEM` acts as a bridge table to implement the many-to-many relationship between `ORDER` and `FOOD`.
2. The relationships `ORDER contains ORDER_ITEM` and `FOOD part_of ORDER_ITEM` together represent this many-to-many link: one order can include multiple food items, and one food item can appear in multiple orders.
3. `item_name` in `ORDER_ITEM` stores a copy of the food name to simplify display of order summaries.
4. Pickup times are user-defined; no fixed slot table is needed.
5. Payment is one-to-one per order.
6. Vendors manage their own `FOOD` items.
7. `ORDER.status` tracks the order lifecycle from pending to delivered.
